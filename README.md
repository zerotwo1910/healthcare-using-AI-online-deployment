## Project Overview

The **Healthcare AI Platform** is a web-based application designed to predict heart disease risk using machine learning models. Built with Flask, it provides an intuitive interface for users to input patient data, view predictions, explore the dataset, and analyze model performance through visualizations. The platform leverages a heart disease dataset (`heart.csv`) and employs multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to deliver accurate predictions and insightful analytics.

This project is intended for **educational purposes only** and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

## Features

- **Heart Disease Prediction**: Input patient data through a user-friendly form to predict the likelihood of heart disease, with probability scores and clear result presentation.
- **Dataset Exploration**: View the loaded heart disease dataset (up to 100 rows) in a tabular format.
- **Model Visualizations**: Analyze model performance with visualizations such as ROC Curve, Precision-Recall Curve, Confusion Matrix, and Model Metrics (Accuracy, F1 Score, Precision, Recall, AUC-ROC).
- **Patient Analytics**: Explore feature importance, correlation matrix, and patient distribution visualizations to understand data patterns and model behavior.
- **Error Handling**: Robust validation of input data and informative error messages via Flask flash messages.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive UI compatible across devices.

## Dataset

The system utilizes the standardized Heart Disease Dataset from Kaggle containing:

- **Size**: 303 patient records with 13 clinical predictors
- **Features**: Demographic, symptomatic, and diagnostic measurements
- **Target**: Binary classification (0 = No disease, 1 = Disease present)

| `age` | Age in years | Numerical |
| `sex` | Sex (1 = male; 0 = female) | Categorical |
| `cp` | Chest pain type (0-3) | Categorical |
| `trestbps` | Resting blood pressure (mm Hg) | Numerical |
| `chol` | Serum cholesterol (mg/dl) | Numerical |
| `fbs` | Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl | Binary |
| `restecg` | Resting ECG results | Categorical |

```

### Data Preprocessing Pipeline

1. **Missing Value Imputation**:
   - Numerical features: Median imputation
   - Categorical features: Mode imputation

2. **Outlier Detection & Treatment**:
   - IQR method for identification
   - Capping strategy for treatment

3. **Feature Transformation**:
   - One-hot encoding for categorical variables
   - StandardScaler for numerical features

4. **Train-Test Split**:
   - 80-20 split with stratification

### Feature Engineering

- **Interaction Features**:
  - Age × Cholesterol
  - Age × Blood Pressure

- **Binning**:
  - Age groups (30-45, 45-60, 60+)

- **Categorical Expansion**:
  - One-hot encoding: cp, thal, slope

## Key Insights

- **Primary Predictors**:
  1. ST depression during exercise (oldpeak)
  2. Chest pain type (cp)
  3. Thalassemia (thal)
  4. Maximum heart rate achieved (thalach)

- **Clinical Relevance**:
  - Strong correlation between exercise-induced angina and disease presence
  - Males demonstrate higher disease prevalence
  - ST depression emerges as the most significant predictor

- **Model Behavior**:
  - Gradient Boosting achieves highest accuracy and recall
  - Feature importance rankings align with established cardiovascular risk factors

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/healthcare-ai-platform.git
   cd healthcare-ai-platform
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Alternatively, install the libraries manually:
   ```bash
   pip install flask pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn
   ```

4. **Prepare the Dataset**
   - Ensure the `heart.csv` dataset is placed in the project root directory. The dataset should contain the following columns: `Age`, `Sex`, `CP`, `Trestbps`, `Chol`, `Fbs`, `Restecg`, `Thalach`, `Exang`, `Oldpeak`, `Slope`, `CA`, `Thal`, and `Target`.

5. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The application will start at `http://localhost:5000` (or the port specified in your environment).

## Usage

1. **Access the Application**
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.
   - The homepage displays a form to input patient data for heart disease prediction.

2. **Predict Heart Disease**
   - Fill in the patient data form with appropriate values for features like Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, etc.
   - Submit the form to receive a prediction ("Disease Detected" or "No Disease Detected") along with a probability score.

3. **Explore the Dataset**
   - Navigate to the `/dataset` route to view the first 100 rows of the heart disease dataset in a tabular format.

4. **Model Visualizations**
   - Visit `/model_visualisations` to see performance metrics, ROC Curve, Precision-Recall Curve, and Confusion Matrix for the trained model.

5. **Patient Analytics**
   - Go to `/patient_visualisations` to view Feature Importance, Correlation Matrix, and Patient Distribution visualizations.

## Machine Learning Models

The platform trains three models and selects the best-performing one based on test accuracy:
- **Logistic Regression**: A linear model for binary classification.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble model using decision trees.
- **XGBoost**: A gradient boosting model optimized for performance.

The models are trained on scaled features, with categorical variables one-hot encoded and missing values imputed (median for numeric, mode for categorical).

## Limitations

- **Educational Use Only**: The predictions are not intended for clinical use.
- **Dataset Dependency**: Requires a correctly formatted `heart.csv` file.
- **Binary Classification**: The current implementation assumes a binary target variable.
- **Visualization Limits**: Some visualizations (e.g., ROC Curve) are only generated for binary classification tasks.
